## Requirements
look at a ‘back in game’ stat. What this stat would be looking at is does the player get off the ground after an action and run for the first 3 to 5 metres to then make him be ready for his next action earlier than if they walked. 
This could be from tackle, ball carry, clean outs, basically if they’re in a tackle zone, whether they were attacking or defending it’s the next action out of that being a run not a walk. 
there is a potential framework to categorise the actions of players against.  it's from one of the recognised analysis platforms - see attached image


let's do an analysis of poss of each time the player hits the ground and time to be up and time to get back into position (per Andi's message above)
