# Gemini Research Prompt
cat > /tmp/gemini-research.txt << 'EOF'
Research the top 5 machine learning approaches for rugby injury analysis:
1. Focus on "back in game" prediction models
2. Include pros and cons for each approach
3. Cite recent papers or methods
4. Rank by effectiveness
Output as markdown with clear sections.

# Qwen Code Generation Prompt
cat > /tmp/qwen-codegen.txt << 'EOF'
Generate a complete Python module for rugby player data analysis:
- Class: RugbyPlayerData
- Methods: load_csv, validate_data, calculate_return_time, export_report
- Use pandas, numpy, and type hints
- Include docstrings
- Follow PEP 8
Output as clean Python code only.
