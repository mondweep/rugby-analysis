## How to Use This for Your Videos

### STEP 1: Watch Videos & Code Events

Open the videos and use this template for each ground contact:

**For each player hitting the ground, record:**

| What to Record | How to Measure |
|----------------|----------------|
| Timestamp | Video time (e.g., 02:34) |
| Player Number | Jersey # |
| Event Type | Tackle/Ball Carry/Ruck/Cleanout |
| Time on Ground | Pause when player contacts ground, unpause when standing ‚Üí count seconds |
| Recovery Method | Do they RUN or WALK the first 3-5 meters? |
| Time to Ready | Total time from ground contact until ready for next action |

### STEP 2: Assign Grades

Use this simple guide:

- **A (Green)** = Springs up immediately, sprints to position (< 2 seconds)
- **B (Yellow)** = Quick recovery, jogs to position (2-3 seconds)
- **C (Orange)** = Slow to feet, walks then jogs (3-5 seconds)
- **D (Red)** = Very slow, walks to position (> 5 seconds)

### STEP 3: Enter Data

Use Excel/Google Sheets with these columns:

```
Video_ID | Timestamp | Player_Number | Event_Type | Hit_Ground | Time_On_Ground | Recovery_Method | Time_To_Ready | Back_In_Game_Grade | Notes
```

### STEP 4: Calculate Summary

For each player calculate:
- Total events
- RUN recovery % (RUN events / Total events)
- Average time to ready
- Back in Game Score (A+B grades / Total events)

## Key Metrics to Track

### Individual Player Metrics
‚úÖ **RUN Recovery Rate** - Target: >80%  
‚úÖ **Back in Game Score** - Target: >80% (A+B grades)  
‚úÖ **Average Time to Ready** - Target: <2.5 seconds  

### Team Metrics
‚úÖ **Overall RUN Recovery Rate** - Team average  
‚úÖ **Defence vs Attack vs Breakdown** - Compare categories  
‚úÖ **Player Rankings** - Identify top and bottom performers

## Sample Event Coding

**Example from Video 1 at 00:45:**

```
Video_ID: Video_1
Timestamp: 00:45
Player_Number: 7
Event_Type: Tackle_Made
Event_Category: Defence
Hit_Ground: Yes
Time_On_Ground: 1.1 seconds (measured frame-by-frame)
Recovery_Method: RUN (sprinted immediately to position)
Time_To_Ready: 1.6 seconds (total from tackle to ready)
Back_In_Game_Grade: A (elite recovery)
Notes: Excellent urgency shown, immediate sprint
```

## Quick Tips for Accurate Coding

1. **Use Video Controls**
   - Pause/play to measure exact times
   - Slow motion for ground contact assessment
   - Multiple angles to verify recovery method

2. **Be Consistent**
   - Use the same criteria for all players
   - Check all 4 camera angles
   - Note confidence in each coding

3. **Context Matters**
   - Note match situation in comments
   - Track fatigue across match time
   - Consider previous sequence involvement

4. **Quality Control**
   - Code the same event twice to verify
   - Have second coder check sample
   - Review outliers for accuracy

## Framework Alignment

This analysis framework maps to the professional platform structure shown in your image:

**ATTACK Category:**
- Ball Carry ‚Üí tracked with recovery
- Ball Placement ‚Üí included in event notes
- Passes/Offloads ‚Üí can be added if ground contact

**DEFENCE Category:**
- Tackles (Individual/Double/Assist) ‚Üí all tracked
- Post Tackle Effort ‚Üí captured in recovery method
- Missed Tackles ‚Üí noted in context

**BREAKDOWN Category:**
- Ruck Arrival (1st/2nd/3rd) ‚Üí recorded
- Ruck Type (Cleanout/Seal/Support) ‚Üí event type
- Ruck Efficiency ‚Üí graded A-D

The "back in game" stat adds a new dimension by measuring the **speed and method of recovery** after these events, which directly impacts work rate and match effectiveness.
