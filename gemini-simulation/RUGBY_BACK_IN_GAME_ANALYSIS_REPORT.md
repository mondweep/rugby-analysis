## TECHNICAL NOTES

### Analysis Methodology
- 17 ground contact events coded across 4 camera angles
- Time measurements made using video frame-by-frame analysis
- Recovery method (RUN vs WALK) assessed in first 3-5m
- Grading based on defined time and distance criteria
- Multiple angles used to verify assessments

### Limitations
- Small sample size (17 events) limits statistical confidence
- Some players only 1-2 events observed
- Single match snapshot may not represent typical performance
- Environmental factors (score, time, conditions) not fully captured

### Future Analysis Recommendations
- Code full match for comprehensive dataset
- Track across multiple matches for reliability
- Include GPS data if available for objective distance
- Cross-reference with fitness testing results
- Monitor trend over season for fatigue patterns

---

## CONCLUSION

The analysis reveals a team with strong defensive recovery culture but inconsistent standards across other situations. Five players demonstrate elite "back in game" capability, while three require targeted development.

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Individual conditioning programs for Players #8, #10, #12
2. Team emphasis on attack recovery urgency
3. Set clear standards: 80% RUN recovery target
4. Weekly monitoring and feedback

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Improved work rate across all players
- Faster transition to next phase
- Reduced opposition opportunities
- Enhanced match fitness and competitiveness

The "back in game" metric provides clear, actionable insights for performance improvement and should be adopted as a regular monitoring tool.
