Here are three key machine learning approaches for sports injury prediction:

1.  **Ensemble Methods (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost):** These models combine multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control for overfitting. They are effective at handling diverse datasets that include training load, biometric data, and player history.

2.  **Deep Learning (e.g., Neural Networks):** These models are well-suited for analyzing complex patterns in large datasets. They are particularly powerful for processing sensor and video data to identify subtle biomechanical risk factors that might otherwise be missed.

3.  **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** SVMs are effective for classification tasks, such as predicting whether an injury will occur or not. They work by finding the optimal boundary to separate data points into different classes (e.g., 'injured' vs. 'not injured').
