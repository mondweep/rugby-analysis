üéØ WHAT THIS PACKAGE DOES
================================================================================

ANALYZES: Player recovery speed and method after ground contact
MEASURES: Time to ready + RUN vs WALK recovery
GRADES: A (Elite) to D (Poor) based on speed/urgency
OUTPUTS: Individual player reports + team performance metrics

EVENT TYPES TRACKED:
- Tackles (made/received)
- Ball carries (when tackled)
- Ruck/breakdown involvement
- Cleanouts and support
- Any ground contact in tackle zones

================================================================================
üìä SAMPLE RESULTS (from 17 coded events)
================================================================================

TEAM PERFORMANCE:
- RUN Recovery Rate: 70.6% (Target: 80%)
- Back in Game Score: 70.6% (A+B grade rate)
- Average Time to Ready: 2.68s (Target: <2.5s)

TOP PERFORMERS (100% RUN recovery):
- Player #7: 4 events, 1.8s avg, Grade A
- Player #4: 2 events, 1.5s avg, Grade A
- Player #21: 1 event, 1.5s avg, Grade A

DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY (0% RUN recovery):
- Player #8: 2 events, 5.2s avg, Grade C+
- Player #10: 1 event, 3.8s avg, Grade B

PERFORMANCE BY CONTEXT:
- Defence: 83.3% RUN (Strongest)
- Attack: 66.7% RUN (Development needed)
- Breakdown: 60.0% RUN (Variable)

STEP 2: PREPARE (15 min)
‚Üí Open rugby_back_in_game_raw_data.csv
‚Üí Set up Excel/Google Sheets for coding
‚Üí Review grading criteria

STEP 3: CODE VIDEOS (2-3 hours)
‚Üí Watch videos, pause at ground contacts
‚Üí Record: timestamp, player, event type
‚Üí Measure: time on ground, time to ready
‚Üí Assess: RUN or WALK recovery
‚Üí Assign: grade A-D

STEP 4: ANALYZE (1 hour)
‚Üí Calculate player summaries
‚Üí Compute team metrics
‚Üí Generate performance rankings

STEP 5: REPORT (1 hour)
‚Üí Use REPORT.md as template
‚Üí Write player assessments
‚Üí Create team summary
‚Üí Develop training recommendations

TOTAL TIME: ~5 hours for complete analysis

================================================================================
üìè GRADING SCALE
================================================================================

A (GREEN)    - Elite Recovery    - <2s to ready - Sprint 3-5m
B (YELLOW)   - Good Recovery     - 2-3s to ready - Quick jog/run
C (ORANGE)   - Average Recovery  - 3-5s to ready - Walk then jog
D (RED)      - Poor Recovery     - >5s to ready  - Walk only

================================================================================
üéì KEY METRICS
================================================================================

RUN RECOVERY RATE:
- Definition: % of events with running (not walking) recovery
- Formula: (RUN events / Total events) √ó 100
- Target: >80%

BACK IN GAME SCORE:
- Definition: % of A+B grade performances
- Formula: (A+B grades / Total events) √ó 100
- Target: >80%

AVERAGE TIME TO READY:
- Definition: Mean seconds from contact to ready for next action
- Measurement: Video frame-by-frame timing
- Target: <2.5 seconds

================================================================================
üí° TRAINING APPLICATIONS
================================================================================

USE THIS ANALYSIS TO:
‚úì Set objective work rate standards
‚úì Identify conditioning needs
‚úì Inform substitution timing
‚úì Benchmark against opponents
‚úì Track improvement over time
‚úì Provide player feedback
‚úì Design targeted drills

RECOMMENDED DRILLS:
1. Contact ‚Üí Sprint Recovery (builds automatic habits)
2. Ruck ‚Üí Reaction (improves breakdown recovery)
3. Fatigue Recovery (maintains quality under pressure)
4. Position-Specific Circuits (role-appropriate conditioning)

================================================================================
üîó PLATFORM INTEGRATION
================================================================================

This framework aligns with professional rugby analysis platforms:

STANDARD PLATFORM CATEGORIES:
- ATTACK: Ball Carry, Placement, Catch/Pass (A-B-C-D grades)
- DEFENCE: Tackles, Effort, Contest (A-B-C-D grades)
- BREAKDOWN: Arrival, Type, Efficiency (A-B-C-D grades)

THIS FRAMEWORK ADDS:
- Recovery Speed measurement
- Recovery Method (RUN vs WALK) classification
- Work Rate quantification
- Conditioning insights

INTEGRATION: Use platform for actions, add "back in game" for recovery.

================================================================================
‚úÖ QUALITY STANDARDS
================================================================================

YOUR ANALYSIS SHOULD:
‚úì Code all ground contact events
‚úì Cross-verify across 4 camera angles
‚úì Apply consistent criteria to all players
‚úì Use objective time measurements
‚úì Identify clear development priorities

================================================================================
üìà EXPECTED OUTCOMES
================================================================================

SHORT TERM (1-2 weeks):
- Players aware of standards
- Training emphasis on recovery
- Baseline metrics established

MEDIUM TERM (1-3 months):
- Measurable improvement in RUN %
- Conditioning gaps addressed
- Team work rate increases

LONG TERM (Season):
- Consistent 80%+ RUN recovery
- Elite performance maintained
- Competitive advantage gained
