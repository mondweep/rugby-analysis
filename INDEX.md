## 📊 Platform Integration

This framework aligns with the professional analysis platform shown in your uploaded image:

**Your Platform Structure:**
- ATTACK: Ball Carry, Placement, Catch/Pass, etc. (A-B-C-D grades)
- DEFENCE: Tackles, Effort, Contest, etc. (A-B-C-D grades)
- BREAKDOWN: Arrival, Type, Efficiency, etc. (A-B-C-D grades)

**This Framework Adds:**
- **Recovery Speed** measurement
- **Recovery Method** (RUN vs WALK) classification
- **Work Rate** quantification
- **Conditioning** insights

**Integration:** Use existing platform for actions, add "back in game" stat for recovery analysis.
